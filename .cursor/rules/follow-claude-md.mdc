# Follow claude.md Files

When working in this project:

1. **Discover**: At the start of relevant work, check for `claude.md` in the project root and in the directory (or parent directories) of any files you are editing or discussing.

2. **Read**: If a `claude.md` exists, read it before making changes or giving guidance. Treat it as project instructions and documentation.

3. **Follow**: Apply the standards, scope, and guidance in `claude.md` as you would follow dedicated project rules—encoding, syntax, organization, and any references to other docs (e.g. the Assetto Corsa Modding Manual) must be respected.

4. **Scope**: Prefer the nearest `claude.md` (e.g. in the current folder or a parent) when multiple exist; combine or prioritize root-level project context when appropriate.

Do not skip or summarize away instructions in `claude.md`; treat them as authoritative for this project.
