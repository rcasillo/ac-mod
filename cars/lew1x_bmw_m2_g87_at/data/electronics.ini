[ABS]
; BMW M Compound Brakes with ABS
; M2 uses high-performance ABS with rapid cycling
; Slip ratio limit: 10-12% typical for performance ABS

[TRACTION_CONTROL]
; BMW M Traction Control - 10 Level System
; 
; The G8X M cars have one of the most sophisticated TC systems:
; - 10 discrete slip levels (0-9)
; - Level 0 = almost no intervention
; - Level 9 = maximum intervention (similar to DSC on)
; - MDM uses levels 4-7 dynamically based on yaw rate
;
; Key characteristics:
; - Very fast response (<20ms real-world)
; - Uses engine torque reduction as primary method
; - Does NOT use brake intervention (that's DSC's job)
; - Monitors rear wheel speed vs. calculated vehicle speed
;
; RATE_HZ increased to 250 for faster response
; (Real BMW is ~50Hz main loop but with faster sub-loops)

[EDL]
; Electronic Differential Lock (part of M Active Differential)
; Applies brake to spinning wheel to transfer torque
; The M2 has a mechanical LSD, so EDL is supplementary
;
; MAX_SPIN values control how much slip triggers intervention
; BRAKE_TORQUE values control brake force applied
; DEAD_ZONE prevents intervention during normal driving
