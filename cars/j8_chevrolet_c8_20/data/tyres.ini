;
; Ported from BMW M2 G87 model
; Adapted for C8 Corvette Z51 stock staggered sizes:
; - Front: 245/35R19 on 19x8.5 wheels
; - Rear: 305/30R20 on 20x11 wheels
;
; Real-world data sources:
; - 200TW extreme performance summer / track tire
; - ~10-15% more grip than PS4S based on autocross comparisons
; - Targets ~1.15-1.20g lateral sustained
;
; THERMAL DATA from Bridgestone engineer and real-world testing:
; - Optimal temp: 120-130F (49-54C surface), safe up to 160F (71C)
; - Note: AC measures core temp, surface runs ~10-20C hotter
; - Optimal CORE temp in AC: ~50-65C (corresponding to 120-150F surface)
; - Cold start pressures: 25-28 psi
; - Hot target pressures: 32-37 psi (pressure rises 7-14 psi when hot)
